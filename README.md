We have put in the databa several ingredients, dishes with those ingredients and purchases with those dishes. We also have some users and one admin. 

-1 First, without register we access to the menu and we can see that there is nothing we can do.
-2 Now we try to access a restinged page like /add_food and we get the custom error page. 
-3 Now we try to create a new account with the same name that other user and we will get an error.
-4 Then we register with a valid name.
-5 We log in with this user.
-6 Now we access the profile where we can see three parts, a list of purchases, a list of recommended dishes and the place where we can edit the user data.
-7 We add a photo to the user.
-8 Then we go to the menu and add something to the cart.
-9 Now we access the cart and make the payment with the same first name and surname we have.
-10 In profile now are new recommended dishes and the purchase.
-11 Log out and connect as admin.
-12 Go to profile and see all the purchases, we should see the purchase that we just made.
-13 Now we go to the menu and we add an ingredient and a dish.
-14 In the menu, we can also access information about the dishes, and there we can delete or edit a dish.
